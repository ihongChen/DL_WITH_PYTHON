# Deep Learning with python 

This is the exercise and reading note through [this book](https://www.manning.com/books/deep-learning-with-python).

As far as I know author Franscio who is the guy can talk a very difficult theory in a easy way. This is the reason why I want to go through this book seriosly, because of there are lots of math behind deep learning, and the idea behind that math is so obscure. Hope I get closer to DL zone instead of just know lots of buzzwords.
